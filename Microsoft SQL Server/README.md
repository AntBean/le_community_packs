# Microsoft SQL Server

The Microsoft SQL Server Pack contains pre-configured tags, saved queries, and dashboards. These tags and saved queries have been created to help you maintain and troubleshoot your Microsoft SQL Server environment.

This Pack contains the following:

*   **Dashboards:** A dashboard giving visibility into failed backups, occurrence of event codes, and host activity.
*   **Saved Queries:** Searches to help you investigate disk space errors, replication issues, full transaction logs, login errors, file access errors, and possible database corruption.
*   **Tags and Alerts:** Tags highlight instances of important SQL Server events. These tags can quickly be configured as basic alerts, anomaly alerts and inactivity alerts to highlight spikes in important security events, password updates, and policy related events.
