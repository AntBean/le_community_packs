# Mosquitto and MQTT

In order to make the analysis of Mosquitto server logs easier, weâ€™ve developed a Mosquitto pack that can be installed from your Logentries dashboard.

This Pack contains the following:

*   **Dashboards:** A dashboard including a series of timeline graphs and bar charts used to analyze historical data such as: Number of new connections, PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE messages, PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE messages grouped by device ID, and PUBLISH/SUBSCRIBE messages grouped by topic name.
*   **Saved Queries:** Searches to help you investigate key Mosquitto server metrics.
*   **Tags and Alerts:** Tags highlight instances of important events. These tags can quickly be configured as basic alerts, anomaly alerts and inactivity alerts to highlight new connections, address assignment requests, and port connections.
