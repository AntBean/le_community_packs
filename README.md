Community Packs
--------------


What is a Pack?
---------------
A Pack is a pre-configured set of Tags, real-time Alerts, and Dashboards built out for you based on common log management and analysis use cases from our Community. The JSON-based Packs are ready for immediate download and usage in your Logentries account.

How do I add a Pack to my Logentries account?
---------------------------------------------
It's easy. If you're already logged into your Logentries account, select "[Add a Pack](https://logentries.com/doc/community-packs/)" from the left side menu bar and follow the instructions to use the Add a Pack wizard

What if I don't see a Category I need?
--------------------------------------
We are always looking to improve our Packs and add new ones where needed. Let us know what you would want to see by opening an Issue.

Can I submit my own Pack to the Community?
------------------------------------------
Yes! Once you've downloaded the initial Pack, you can easily modify and change the open JSON format to make it your own. Then, we want you to share back with the Community so others can benefit and learn from the Pack youâ€™ve created.
