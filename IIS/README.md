IIS Server Monitoring Pack (RegEx)
----------------------------------

This Community Pack for IIS Server uses RegEx search functionality to extract values from the default IIS Log Format. This pack serves as an example of how RegEx expressions can be used in addition to the common search techniques.

This Pack contains the following:

* Saved Queries: The user is able to use saved searches to get the total or average time for individual requests. This pack is a good example of how to combine the common search techniques with RegEx.
* Tags and Alerts: There are a couple of tags included in this pack e.g. 200 OK, 404 NOT FOUND
* Dashboards: There are multiple graphs included in this pack. The user is able to get an overview of HTTP status codes sent by a server, request types received and list of URLs accessed together with their access count. This pack is equipped with graphs to show the average time required to request either JPG, GIF or PDF file from the server.
