Heroku Postgres Pack
-------------------------------

This Pack for the Heroku Postgres Add-on helps database administrators and application developers to better understand their application behavior and analyze important processes occurring between the app and database.

The Heroku Postgres Add-on Community Pack contains the following:

* Saved Queries: Automatically look for FATAL, WARNING and ERROR type log events and to reveal interesting behaviors across the database.
* Tags and Alerts: Access an extensive collection of pre-installed tags that can be used to understand the messages produced by Postgres. Use real-time alerts to help uncover, for example, the maximum number of connections allowed for your applications. There are more than 15 Tags that come pre-configured in the Community Pack.
* Dashboards: Pre-configured dashboards offer a real-time view of log event distribution by severity level. The user is able to graph an average execution time for slow events that are logged by Heroku Postgres.


Heroku Log Runtime Metrics Pack
-------------------------------

The Heroku log-run-time metrics Community Pack provides visibility into the Heroku runtime metrics that can be enabled for your Heroku apps. Log runtime metrics provide details on CPU and Memory usage of your app. More details can be found here ( https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/log-runtime-metrics ).

This Pack contains the following:

* Insight into load average metrics
* Visibility into Memory broken down into overall memory usage, cache, swap and pages written and read from disk.

The pack also provides visibility into latency metrics for your apps such as the time it takes to serve a response from your app.

This Pack contains the following:

* Saved Queries: Saved Queries that you can reuse to quickly get visibility into your app latency.
